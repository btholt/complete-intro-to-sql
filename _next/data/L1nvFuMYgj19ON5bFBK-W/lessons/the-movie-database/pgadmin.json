{"pageProps":{"post":{"attributes":{"title":"pgAdmin"},"html":"<p>I&#39;m going to show you a quick tool that you can continue using through out the rest of the course or you can just know it&#39;s there and stop using it. Some people and need and love it, some people (like me) got used to using the command line (psql) and don&#39;t use it as much.</p>\n<p>I speak of <a href=\"https://www.pgadmin.org/\">pgAdmin</a>. Very similar to <a href=\"https://www.phpmyadmin.net/\">phpMyAdmin</a> for MySQL, it exposes a GUI to interact with a PostgreSQL database. Again, I&#39;m not super familiar with its workings but I can help you get it running and you can toy with it a bit.</p>\n<p>In your app that you cloned, there is <a href=\"https://github.com/btholt/sql-apps/blob/main/docker-compose.yml\">a Docker Compose file</a> that you can use to get PostgreSQL spun up with pgAdmin.</p>\n<p>In the root directory of your sql-apps directory, run the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that the following will download the pgAdmin container, about ~400MB in size.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You also may need to <code>docker kill sql</code> since they&#39;ll both try to listen on port <code>5432</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">docker compose up\n</code></pre>\n<p>After you see the PostgreSQL database start up then the pgAdmin container start up, try going to <a href=\"http://localhost:1234\">localhost:1234</a>. From there log in with <code>admin@example.com</code> and <code>example</code>.</p>\n<p>Once in the menu, follow these instructions:</p>\n<p>Click &quot;Add New Server&quot;.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/add-new-server.png\" alt=\"Add new server\"></p>\n<p>Add a name. You can call it whatever you want, it&#39;s just internal to pgAdmin. I called mine db. After that, click connection.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/connection.png\" alt=\"Add a name then click connection\"></p>\n<p>Here you need to</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Put <code>db</code> ad the hostname/address (as this is what Docker Compose is exposing the host as to the pgAdmin container)</li>\n<li>Put port as <code>5432</code></li>\n<li>Leave maintenance database as <code>postgres</code></li>\n<li>Put username as <code>postgres</code></li>\n<li>Put password as <code>lol</code></li>\n<li>Save password</li>\n<li>Click save</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/images/config.png\" alt=\"Config of adding a server in pgAdmin\"></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If save is grayed out, you likely didn&#39;t add a name on the General tab.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here you can click around the pgAdmin page and see what you can do. Maybe start by writing some queries by using the Tools &gt; Query Tool.</p>\n","slug":"pgadmin","title":"pgAdmin","section":"The Movie Database","icon":"clapperboard","filePath":"/home/runner/work/complete-intro-to-sql/complete-intro-to-sql/lessons/08-the-movie-database/C-pgadmin.md","nextSlug":"/lessons/query-performance/explain","prevSlug":"/lessons/the-movie-database/answers"}},"__N_SSG":true}
